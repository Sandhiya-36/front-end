        <p >Shopping foods online is different from shopping other things online. To stimulate
             more thinking and enrich potential future research imagination, this paper reviews for online food 
             shopping features, offers a commentary, and proposes future research directions. The propositions include 
             the following: (1) The design and implementation of online food shopping (eco)systems should engage the
              consumers and other stakeholders to co-create collective and social values; (2) A better fit between 
              technologies’ and food businesses’ natures could generate better applications for online food shopping; 
              (3) A business model with sound finance systems becomes the core of a healthy online food ecosystem;
               (4) The interaction and transformation between online (virtual) and offline (virtual) food businesses
                determines the dynamic development of future food shopping.study on consumer preference and attitudes
                 regarding online
                 food products examines how the Internet has changed people’s food-buying behaviors. The study is significant 
                 because it establishes the underlying consumers’ concerns with regards to food safety information, especially
                  for online food products. Compared to other products, consumer preferences and attitudes toward buying food 
                  online differs in that the perceived risks and information quality do not play major roles in influencing thei
                  r buying behavior (Li and Bautista, 2019; Sanchez-Sabate and Sabaté, 2019; Zieliñska et al., 2020). Kim Dang et 
                  al. (2018) study relies on a cross-sectional study conducted in Hanoi, Vietnam. The findings are reliable as they
                   are based on responses gathered from over 1736 customers through face-to-face interviews. While the preferences
                    and attitudes toward buying food online differ from buying other commodities, Kim Dang et al. (2018) note that
                     the laws governing e-commerce in Vietnam are the same. As such, the findings provide practical advice to online
                      food retailers and the Vietnam government on how to implement appropriate legislation with regards to trading
                       online food products.
                 Martínez-Ruiz and Gómez-Cantó’s (2016) study emphasizes that using the Internet to seek food service information 

                has now become a common practice among people today. More people than ever before have positive attitudes toward
                 finding
                 information about food online (Martínez-Ruiz and Gómez-Cantó, 2016; Maison et al., 2018). Also, people are more 
                 likely to search information about food on the Internet than any other product or service (Hidalgo-Baz et al., 
                 2017; Whiley et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2018). However, Kim Dang et al. (2018) study found that a significant
                  number of consumers were unconcerned about the accuracy of the evidence regarding food safety they found online 
                  in selecting food products on the Internet. The conclusions drawn from the current article review produces 
                  practical pieces of advice to consumers buying food online as well as the food retailers selling food over
                   the Internet.
                
                Marketing Approaches
                Rummo et al. (2020) examine the relationship between youth-targeted food marketing expenditures and the demographics
                 of social media followers. The authors sought to establish the extent to which teenagers follow food brands on Twit
                 ter and Instagram by examining the relationships between brands’ youth-targeted marketing practices and the overall
                  percentages of adolescent followers. The study provides evidence showing that unhealthy food brands, especially fa
                  st food and sugary drink have more adolescent followers on social media (Rummo et al., 2020). These study results 
                  are consistent with Salinas et al. (2014) findings which show that unhealthy food products enjoy a higher market


                   base than the healthy ones. The high percentage of teenage followers is concerning among health experts mainly 
                   because most of the advertisements from these companies are biased and do not highlight the unhealthy consequence
                   s associated with eating these foods. Compared to other products, food companies are often not required by regula
                   tions to highlight their negative consequences (Salinas et al., 2014). For example, cigarette and alcohol compani
                   es are mandated to disclose their effects of use on all marketing materials (Gravely et al., 2014). Consequently,
                    with the ubiquitous use of social media by teenagers, young people are more exposed to food and beverage adverti
                    sing which occurs across multiple digital channels.
                
                The failure to address digital advertising when formulating policies makes it harder to governed youth-targeted
                 food
                 marketing. Food products are often marketed using the general techniques and approaches applied in other products
                  and services. Juaneda-Ayensa et al. (2016) note that food marketing topics such as market segmentation, strategi
                  c positioning, test marketing, branding, consumer research, targeting, and market entry strategy are highly rele
                  
                  vant. Moreover, food marketing is affected by the major challenges that affect conventional markets such as deal
                  ing with perishable products whose availability and quality varies as a function of the current harvest conditio
                  ns (Hongyan and Zhankui, 2017). However, Topolinski et al. (2015) note that the value chain in food marketing is
                  
                  particularly important because it highlights the extent to which sequential parties within the marketing channel 
                  add value to the final product. According to Linder et al. (2018) processing new distribution options often 
                   additional opportunities available to food marketers to provide the final consumer with convenience. However, wh
                   en overhead costs such as marketing and processing are added they result in significantly higher costs (Lou and 
                   Kim, 2019).
                
                Demographics play an essential role in food marketing almost more than any other product. According to Qobadi and 
                Payton (2017), food companies must utilize statistical demographics to understand the inherent characteristics of 
                a population. For food marketing purposes, such knowledge can help firms develop a better understanding of the c
                urrent market place as well as predict future trends (Isselmann DiSantis et al., 2017). For example, with regards to the current market, food companies interested in entering a new market with sports drinks might first study the overall number of people between the ages of 15 and 35, who would constitute a particularly significant market. In such cases, most food companies often prefer shifting their resources toward products consumed by a growing population. As such, the success of the marketing strategy employed by a food company is contingent on how good it studies the demographical makeup of its target market.
                
                Packaging and Delivery Consideration
                One of the primary consideration food consumers take into account when making a purchase decision online involves p
                ackaging and delivery. According to Chen et al. (2019), the modern consumer is more interested in food products that utilize sustainable packaging and delivery systems. Hu et al. (2019) add that most customers today are more focused on recyclable packaging systems. Grace (2015) further notes that sustainability is one of the primary sustainability attributes online shoppers look for. For example, over 33% of online consumers believe that packaging and recyclability are more important to them when ordering food items online (Gutberlet et al., 2013). Additionally, 13% of online shoppers cite a lack of packaging information available online, which suggests that there is an existing opportunity for e-retailers to increase their sustainability information (Quartey et al., 2015).
                
                As the world continue grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, online purchases for fresh food is gradually becoming the norm across the world. As such, food producers must be able to adapt accordingly to take advantage of the emerging market. However, the majority of consumers are still concerned about freshness and food waste (Yu et al., 2020). Unlike in a brick-and-mortar store where shoppers can visibly check the freshness of their produce, this is more difficult with home delivery (Song et al., 2016). Thus, brands must try and opt for packaging that can keep food safe and fresh during transit and displays its freshness to re-assure customers. Moreover, to meet sustainability goals, fresh food brands need to balance the use of more sustainable, recyclable materials, with packaging that continues to extend shelf life and avoid food waste.
                
                Conceptual Analysis for Future Research Propositions
                The article review shows that sufficient studies have been conducted on online food shopping. As more people start shopping online, the number of articles on online food shopping is expected to increase. However, despite studies on online food shopping and business models remain rife, there are key gaps in research. These gaps are a result of the majorities of the researchers’ focus on highlighting their perspectives and largely ignore those of the consumers and businesses. Moreover, these studies do not consider crisis (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) when making these future predictions. The forecasts made about future help in developing a better understanding of the various implications of ordering via mobile apps. Also, it provides a background for examining the emerging technologies in online food ordering. As such, the critical propositions reflected in the literature review propose the following four future research directions.
                
                Value Co-creation With Stakeholders
                From a business perspective, getting partners and investors on board is not easy and most restaurants tend to stay away from technology. Thus, the preposition made involves conducting research aimed at developing a better understanding of the customer and business’ perspectives. According to Chen et al. (2018), setting the commission rates with restaurants is a major problem within the online food industry. Moreover, the majority of startups are depended on restaurants to deliver food at the customer’s doorstep (Onyeneho and Hedberg, 2013). Hwang et al. (2020) argue that relying on technology is not the main focus of a restaurant because preparing food is its main core business. As such, even if an investor trusts a food startup, integrating technology within its business process will always be perceived as a high risk. The lack of sufficient evidence on the business’ perspective toward technology and online platforms make it more difficult for rescuers to tailor their studies to generate crucial insights that help in making better business decisions.
                
                One of the problems identified from the consumer’s perspective is that most of the things mentioned in the online food menus are often not available. Instead, they act as click baits designed to entice online users to continue interacting with their platform and marketing content (Lara-Navarra et al., 2020). In rare cases, some clickbait links often forward online users to pages that require them to make payments, register, or even fill in their payment details. Consequently, a significant communication gap exists between consumers and restaurants while shopping on phone and online. While numerous studies examine the purchase intention of food among online shoppers, few highlight the inherent challenges experienced by consumers as they go about their day.
                
                While it is crucial to investigate both perspectives, more studies need to be conducted on the customer ones. This is because most online businesses often find it difficult to deal with customers, but Ho et al. (2014) note that this is usually because they do not see things from the buyers’ point of view. The authors, however, refutes the popular phrase that “customer is always right” and notes that even when they are completely wrong, they can always win. For example, customers can criticize a business online or even refuse to pay their bills. As such, failing to grasp a customer’s perspective can result in a meltdown with them which is always bad business. It is also essential for future businesses to take into consideration the fact that work is much more enjoyable and profitable when people work alongside the customer rather than against them. Thus, conducting more studies aimed at understanding customers can help develop the necessary recommendations to help businesses see things from their point of view.
                
                One of the ways future studies can explore to better understand the customer’s perspective involves exploring the issues related to empathy. Charles et al. (2018) note that empathy does note naturally to most people but it reinforces one’s ability to understand and share the feelings of a customer by placing themselves in their shoes. Future studies should highlight how online businesses can ask questions about how their current and potential customers would feel in different circumstances. Also, future studies must examine how well online businesses can listen to their customers. Afshar Jahanshahi and Brem (2018) notes that the first step in customer relations involves actively listen to them. Finally, future studies must be able to provide recommendations on how online food businesses can grow trust and show respect to their customers. The prepositions made with regards to the business and customers’ perspective provides the background information for future studies. Also, bridging the current research gaps will help business adopt a more effective online model that maximizes customer satisfaction when purchasing foods. Based on the discussions above, this article suggests the following proposition to both identify the gap in the literature and the corresponding future research directions.
                
                Proposition 1: the design and implementation of online food shopping (eco)systems should engage the consumers and other stakeholders to co-create collective and social values.
                
                Technological Nature
                Although smartphone apps provide an efficient way to replace the conventional methods of ordering food through a phone call, there lacks sufficient evidence on the implications of placing orders through them. A partial but potentially important reason is the lack of in-depth and broader understanding of the technology per se. Mobile ordering apps have caused a significant change in food delivery and pickup business (Onyeneho and Hedberg, 2013). With more and more retailers and restaurants adopting these technologies, the modern consumer is willing to place fewer delivery and pickup orders through their phones. Instead, they are now opting to utilize mobile apps. Studies aimed at exploring the implications of food delivery apps help in establishing whether it is hurting or assisting the business. Thus, as a restaurant owner, one has to be careful with regards to utilizing third-party services to do business. For instance, apps such as Uber Eats have endless possibilities as they make delivery faster, for both the customers and the business. However, future studies must examine the potential disadvantages to using such third-party services. Firstly, the added cost of a food delivery app may be prohibitive to most customers. For example, the cost of using services like Uber Eats changes how businesses price their meals. In the end, customers are likely to end up paying more. Thus, future studies have to consider this fact when developing recommendations on how businesses can use food delivery apps without undermining their financial positions. Also, 
                these studies will help show how customers are likely to react to a price surges.</p>
                
                Subsequent studies on the implications of ordering food through mobile apps should also focus on the issues relating to control and accountability. Cecchi and Cavinato (2019) note that some customers have complained about being unable to control the food ordering process. For example, once the customer’s food is in the possession of the Uber driver, there is little left for them to do, which is perceived as a bad thing. Also, Isoni Auad et al. (2018) note that customers lack control over how their drivers handle their food. One of the consequences of being unable to control the process is that when a customer’s food is mishandled or ends up late, the restaurant is the one that is held accountable. Finally, with regards to the implications, future studies must monitor their third party service to safeguard their brand’s reputation. As such, subsequent studies need to ensure that they highlight the importance of maintaining an effective brand image. Mao et al. (2018) recommend online food businesses to monitor how long it takes their delivery people to transport their customers’ food to establish whether it is being handled with the necessary care it deserves. However, more studies are required to highlight the customer’s grievance which can easily fall on the businesses when the delivery issues are ignored.
                
                Despite the various implications of using mobile apps to order food online, there are numerous benefits associated with online models. As such, as the growth of online applications continues, the subsequent studies need to add to the existing literature on the benefits businesses are likely to accrue from adopting such technologies. According to Li et al. (2020), this trend is a result of the numerous benefits associated with using the apps compared to the conventional methods of shopping over the phone or waiting in line. These benefits are 2-fold, they include benefits to the consumer and the restaurants. Firstly, there are numerous consumer benefits of using mobile ordering apps to purchase food.
                
                Consumers across the world are downloading mobile ordering apps at lightning speed. For example, When Chick-fil-A, one of the largest American fast food restaurant chains, released its first official app, it reached first place in the app store in only 3 days after it was launched. Mayordomo-Martínez et al. (2019) note that these apps are popular for four main reasons. Firstly, customers feel that no one is waiting in line or getting put on hold. Secondly, customers can pick up food on the go. Thirdly, customers get the whole menu right at their fingertips, including items they may not have known existed. Finally, most restaurants award patrons’ loyalty reward points. In most cases, these points are easy to track directly through applications and lead to big savings if the customer order frequently.
                
                The restaurant benefits from the mobile ordering apps too. While these apps may be created for the customer, they achieve some important objectives that can greatly help out the restaurant or retail store as well (Ferguson and Solo-Gabriele, 2016). For example, they can handle more orders as is the case with Chipotle, an American chain of fast-casual restaurants, which claims that it is capable of processing six additional orders every hour when placed through a mobile app (Ferguson and Solo-Gabriele, 2016). Moreover, customers are more likely to spend more through an ordering app than in person because they have more time to decide since the entire menu is in front of them and they typically want to score more reward points. Based on the discussion above, this article made the propositions as follow.
                
                Proposition 2: A better fit between technologies’ and food businesses’ natures could generate better applications for online food shopping.</p>
